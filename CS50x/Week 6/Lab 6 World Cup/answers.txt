Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The first one, with the smallest number of matches, because it runs only a few times,
which means the answers won't be precise

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

It seems like the number of 1 000 is quite accurate; the percentages are just slightly
different if not the same as the ones with ten times or 100 times more matches

Here are included time for both of the files: (It din't want to let my code pass when the both walues were up there.)
